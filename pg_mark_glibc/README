pg_mark_glibc
=============

pg_mark_glibc is a binary utility able to register in a given data folder
the version of glibc currently in use by the system, which is useful for
debugging and checking after a system upgrade if the version of glibc in
use is still compatible with the one the data folder has been initialized
with.

Installation
------------

Compiling can be done with "make".  In addition, pg_config must be in $PATH.

Usage
-----

pg_mark_glibc is rather simple to use, requiring only a data folder as
argument.  If nothing is specified, the environment variable PGDATA will
be used.

    pg_mark_glibc -D my_data_folder
